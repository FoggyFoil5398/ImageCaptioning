# ImageCaptioning

Additional Requirements : Flickr8k dataset, Cloud computing(training takes a hell lot of time)

This is a project which uses deep neural network to extract features from an image and use these features to generate sentences or a textual description of the image.
The project utilises CNN and LSTM for feature extraction and word generation respectively.

The project works on Flickr8k dataset. If you have enough computational power you can train the model for flickr30k dataset as well.
